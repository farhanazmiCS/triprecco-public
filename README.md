## What is Triprecco?

Do you love to travel but find planning trips a bit overwhelming with all the details like costs, duration, destinations, and activities? We get it! Thatâ€™s why we created Triprecco, a web app just for you. It uses content-based filtering and similarity search algorithms to find and recommend personalized trip itineraries, making your trip planning faster and easier.

## Hardware Requirements

- Modern Operating System
    - Windows 7 or 10 or above.
    - OS X / MacOS 10.11 or higher.
    - Linux: RHEL 6/7, 64-bit (almost all libraries also work in Ubuntu) or above.
- x86 64-bit CPU (Intel/AMD architecture) or arm64 (MacOS)
- 4GB RAM or above.
- 5GB free disk space or above.

## Software Requirements

- Python 3.12 (This version is necessary as the TF-IDF vectorizer was fitted using this version of Python)
- Any web browser, preferably Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.
- Code Editor: VSCode

## Accessing the App

1. To start using Triprecco, clone this GitHub repository.
2. In the root directory of the folder, run the following command in your shell/terminal to install the necessary packages:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Afterwards, in the root directory, you can start the app by running the following command:

    ```
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

4. At this point, the application should start and you will be redirected to the browser. Happy planning!
